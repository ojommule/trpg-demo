## The general core loop of the game


Venture across the land and sea encountering locals various god related issues, find the demigod party members also helping out along the way, recruit, get XP for them by doing quests that satisfy their god and then eventually clear their respective temples, all the while the monotheists get more organized and good at thwarting you directly
The XP you get from quests gives you combat upgrades, so if you want your Poseidon team member to be stronger, you don't fight more, you go help fishermen navigate the stormy seas
